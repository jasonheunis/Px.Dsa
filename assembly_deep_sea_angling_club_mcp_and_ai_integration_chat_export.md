## 1. Project Background & Requirements

- Digital platform for Assembly Deep Sea Angling Club, with membership management, competition/event handling, scoring, analytics, commerce, etc.
- Entities: Club, Angler, Competition, Team, Boat, Catch, Product, Order, Customer, etc.
- .NET 9 Clean Architecture (FullStackHero FSH)
- Goal: Make this context available to AI agents and future LLM workflows, using MCP standard for AI integration.

---

## 2. MCP (Master Context Provider/Protocol) Overview

- Open protocol to expose structured context to AI/LLMs/tools
- Server exposes resources (entities), tools, and prompts via standard endpoints
- AI agents/tools discover via `.well-known/context` and fetch live data

## 3. Entity Model Mapping & Architecture

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Club                         | club                   | club.js                                 |

## 4. Node.js Starter MCP Implementation

- Clone MCP example server: `git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/examples`
- Add resource files (see samples in chat for club, angler, competition, species, etc.)
- Each file exports `{ id, type, name, description, fetch: async () => [...] }`
- Start server; agents can discover resources

---

## 5. .NET FSH Integration Approach

- Recommended: Add MCP endpoints/controllers/area to the same FSH solution
- Implement `/mcp/resource/{entity}` endpoints for each resource, returning MCP-style arrays
- Expose discovery endpoint at `.well-known/context`:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route(".well-known/context")]
public class ContextDiscoveryController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetContextManifest()
    {
        var manifest = new
        {
            resources = new[]
            {
                new { id = "club", name = "Clubs", description = "All registered clubs.", endpoint = "/mcp/resource/club" },
                new { id = "competition", name = "Competitions", description = "All competitions.", endpoint = "/mcp/resource/competition" },
                new { id = "angler", name = "Anglers", description = "All anglers.", endpoint = "/mcp/resource/angler" }
                // ...
            }
        };
        return Ok(manifest);
    }
}
```

---

## 6. .well-known/context Endpoint Implementation

- Lists all MCP resources as a manifest for client/agent discovery
- Best practice: keep manifest in sync with actual resources

---

## 7. Resources & Recommendations

- [Model Context Protocol on GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)
- [FSH FullStackHero .NET 9 Starter Kit](https://github.com/fullstackhero/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate)
- Use same solution for MCP endpoints for now; refactor into microservice only if necessary
- AI agents/dev tools fetch context from MCP endpoints for live, up-to-date info

how to create master context provider server

### Assistant:

Great question! If you want to create a Master Context Provider (MCP) "server" for your platform...

### User:

Ignore forget previous prompt was meant to ask about how to implement: MCP Master Context Protocol and review [https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) ... Implement in this context for starter to provide guidance and context for prompting and implementing a web app solution for current AI development agents and models like you and only later for LLM and more advanced tasks.

### Assistant:

Excellent! You’re asking: How do I use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to help build and standardize context-serving for your own web app, so that AI agents (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and development tools can reliably fetch structured, real-time context about your system? ... Let me know your preferred language for the server (Node.js, Python, Go), and I’ll generate step-by-step code for your real club data!

### User:

Yes, Want a more concrete starter project, sample Node.js resource code, and then a mapping of your actual entities to MCP resources, resource files for your club’s entities and flows

### Assistant:

Absolutely! Here’s a practical guide for you to set up an MCP server for your club web app, including a starter Node.js project, sample resource files, and a mapping from your real C# entities to MCP resources. ... Want full code samples for any other resource, guidance on “tools” or prompt definitions, or help bridging this to your .NET API/DB? Let me know your next priority!

### User:

I want to use this in my starter project in visual studio to give the AI agent context in this regard, and not sure but was thinking of adding the MCP implementation to the same source code repo or solution if it's best practice or else create separate solution. I've created a project in visual studio with boilerplate FSH FullStackHero .NET Starter Kit is a starting point for your next `.NET 9 Clean Architecture` Solution. Recommend approach and how to do this.

### Assistant:

Great scenario! You’re building with FSH (FullStackHero) .NET 9 Clean Architecture Starter Kit in Visual Studio, and want to add MCP so that AI agents (or future LLM integrations) can fetch live, structured domain context from your system... ... If you want ready-made code snippets for a specific entity (e.g., Competition, Angler), just ask! Or, if you need a context discovery endpoint for .well-known/context or want a starter Visual Studio project/solution structure, let me know your preference.

### User:

context discovery endpoint for .well-known/context

### Assistant:

Absolutely! Here’s how you can implement a context discovery endpoint for MCP at .well-known/context in your FSH/.NET Web API solution...
